        <h2>Hello Friends!</h2>
        <p>
          I am writing to invite you to a special event that will take place on
          24/03/24 at 18:00 at Al Beck. I am eagerly waiting to see your
          presence on such a delightful occasion. Any event is incomplete
          without you, dear. The occasion will be a celebration of my 19th
          birthday, and I can't wait to share this special moment with you.
          There will be food, drinks, music, and lots of fun activities to keep
          you engaged throughout the event. I hope you can join us for this
          special occasion. Please RSVP to mohan243200s@gmail.com or 8610918331
          by 05/03/24 so that we can get a headcount.
